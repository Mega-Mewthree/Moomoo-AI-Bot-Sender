**Installation**
 
*  Download [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
*  `cd` to where you downloaded the folder.
*  Send the following in order.
 
`npm install`
 
 
`node index.js --probeTribe tribeName --probeName playerName --num numberOfBots --link moomooPartyLink --tribe tribeName --name botName --randnames true --chat chatMessage --ai true`
 
* Download [Tampermonkey](https://tampermonkey.net/)
* Copy the contents of this [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/085qf40A ) and put it into the Tampermonkey text editor. If there's anything already existing in the text box delete it. You can get to the editor by clicking the Tampermonkey icon and then clicking `new script`
* Go into MooMoo.io, and your ID should be right next to your age. It is the two digit number.
* Go back to console, and send `setowner yourID`. This will make the bots follower your commands.

**Commands**  
All are to be sent in-game, **not** in console.
 
* Press `[R]` for the bots to come to you
* `!id playerName`: Makes the bots send the ID of a player in chat.
 
* `!fme`: Makes the bots follow you.
 
* `!fid` playerID: Makes the bots follow the player with that ID.
 
* `!atkid playerID`: Makes the bots attack the player with that ID. **[BUGGY]**
 
* `!s`: Makes the bots stay.
 
* `!r`: Releases the bots from control. Different from !s in that pressing R to ping will move them.
 
* `!fm`: Makes the bots follow your mouse. May be buggy if the robot.js lib didn't compile correctly.
